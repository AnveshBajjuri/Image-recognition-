# Image-recognition-
This Python code creates a Tkinter GUI application for object detection and recognition, aimed at assisting visually-impaired individuals. It integrates the InceptionV3 model for recognizing currency notes and the SSD model for detecting various objects in images. Users can load the InceptionV3 model, select an image to identify currency and objects, and view the results in the GUI. Additionally, the application can display training accuracy and loss graphs. The interface includes buttons for these actions, a label for status updates, and a text box for logs and detected object details.

Used Models:
InceptionV3: For currency note recognition.
SSD300 (Single Shot MultiBox Detector): For object detection and classification.
